        <section id="Battles">
            <h2>Battles</h2>
            <h3>No More PP</h3>
            <p>Pokemon's moves will no longer have Power Points (PP). Every move can be used an unlimited number of times.</p>
            <h3>No More Held Items</h3>
            <p>Items cannot be held by your Pokemon like in the original games.</p>
            <h3>No More Items Used in Battles</h3>
            <p>Items cannot be used in Battle. This includes revives, full restores, potions, and X [Stat] items. However, when in a wild
                Pokemon battle, Pokeballs can be used to catch the wild Pokemon. Other than Pokeballs, no items can be used in battle.
                Pokeballs will only be useable in wild Pokemon battles.</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <h3>Quests and Acheivements</h3>
            <h3>The Pokemon League</h3>
            <p><strong>Pokemon OceanBlue</strong> no longer has an <em>Elite Four</em>. Rather, after getting all 8 gym badges, the player can
                challenge the <em>Pokemon League</em>. The <em>Pokemon League</em> is a knockout style tournament with 32 competitors including
                Gym Leaders, past Elite Four members, and Champions from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh.</p>

        <section id="QOL">
            <h2>Quality of Life</h2>
            <h3>No More HMs</h3>
            <p>My personal favourite QOL change is the removal of HMs. If you want to surf, all you need is a water type or ice type in your team.
                And if you don't have a water or ice type Pokemon, you can just buy a Boogie Board from the Cerulean City Bike Shop. Similarly, to
                fly, all you need is a flying or dragon type Pokemon in your team. And of course, if you don't have a flying or dragon type Pokemon,
                just head over to the Cerulean City Bike Shop for a Hang Glider. Also, cut, strength, flash, and rock smash will no longer be
                necessary to get anywhere on the map.</p>
            <h3>Increased Freedom</h3>
            <p>You can travel to whatever city you want and challenge the Gym Leaders in any order. The only exception to this is that the Viridian
                City Gym Leader, Giovanni, can only be challenged once you have collected all of the other 7 gym badges. The strength of Gym
                Leaders, trainers, and wild Pokemon you encounter will be determined by the number of badges you have collected. So, no matter
                what order you challenge the Gyms in, they will increase in difficulty as you collect more badges.</p>
