0,0,Hello young trainer my name is Professor Oak$ the leading Pokemon researcher in Kanto,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
0,1,Today is the day I give new trainers their first Pokemon,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
0,2,All I ask in return is that you take this Pokedex and catch as many Pokemon as you can,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
0,3,There was a time I would have done that myself$ but I'm not as young as I once was,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,
0,4,Between you and me$ I can't even remember my grandson's name anymore,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,
0,5,Anyhow$ now it's time to pick a Pokemon and begin your adventure!,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,

1,0,I heard Professor Oak has been looking for you,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
1,1,Why don't you visit him and see what he wants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000
2,0,Many years ago there were less than 200 species of Pokemon in the Kanto region,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
2,1,Now there are over 400 different Pokemon to be found!,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
2,2,It is a great time to be a Pokemon scientist!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,0,It is important to take good care of your Pokemon,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
3,1,If you are nice to them and take good care of them$ they may perform better in battle!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,0,Hi$ I just caught my first Pokemon and I want to use it! Let's battle!,0,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
4,1,I guess I should train my Pokemon more before making it battle,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
4,2,,,,0,,,,,,36,,,,,
5,0,Have you been to Viridian City?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
5,1,I've heard the Gym Leader there is the strongest in all of Kanto.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
5,2,I can't seem to remember his name though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,0,Our daughter left recently to begin her Pokemon journey...,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
6,1,She was sending us a letter almost every week to let us know how she was doing...,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
6,2,But the past month we haven't got any letters from her and I'm starting to get worried.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
6,3,Do you think you could keep an eye out for her on your journey? Her name is Cassie.,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,
6,4,Last we heard she was heading to Pewter City to fight the Gym Leader there.,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,
6,5,Anyway$ if you hear anything$ let me know. I just want to know she is safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,0,One day$ I'm going to start my own Pokemon journey just like my sister!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,0,...,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
8,1,What could have happened to her?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,0,Hi$ I know what you're thinking. This house is too big for one person...,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
9,1,But the price was right and it's so close to my work at Oak's Lab!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,0,Hey$ can I let you in a secret? I wish I could go live somewhere else further from work.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
10,1,I'm always running into people from work on the weekends and it's just kinda weird y'know?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,0,Hi$ my friend just helped me catch this Ralts. But I won't need help to defeat you!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
11,1,,1,,,,,,,,,wally,green,107,,
12,0,Hey$ have you seen my brother Gary? ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
12,1,No? Okay well he wanted me to tell you that he already has his pokemon and he wants to battle.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
12,2,I think he's on his way to Viridian City if you want to find him. Good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,0,Hey$ it sure took you long enough to get here!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
13,1,Your pokemon look almost as weak as their trainer!,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
13,2,All right$ let's battle!,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,

18,1,Uhh$ sorry. I didn't mean that.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
18,2,I've just been a little on edge lately what with all the team rocket guys around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,0,*sigh*,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
19,1,I haven't been able to see my family in months.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
19,2,They only live in Celadon$ but GioCorp's been giving me so many hours I barely have time to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,0,Hello there.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
20,1,Have you seen the GioCorp Mine? There's some cool pokemon there.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
20,2,Team Rocket guards the entrance during work hours$ but you could probably sneak in at night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,0,I can't believe I paid three months salary for this Magikarp...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,0,Hmm?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
22,1,Who are you?,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
22,2,Ah$ figures. Most the travellers we get around here are also trainers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,0,You should go see Professor Oak to get a Pokemon before wandering into wild grass.,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,
24,0,Sorry$ you can't enter wild grass without a Pokemon.,,,23,,,1,,,,,,,,
24,1,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,
25,0,I like turtles.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,0,HIIYYAAAAAH!!! YOU'RE MINE BUG!!!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
26,1,Hey wait$ you're not a bug Pokemon.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,0,I heard the reason there's no rocket goons here in Viridian is that the gym leader here keeps em out.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
27,1,I don't know who this gym leader is but he has my thanks.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
27,2,I was worried when team rocket started gaining prescence in this area I would have to move my family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,0,You may have noticed there are a lot of miners around here.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
28,1,It's because most of the people who live here work at the GioCorp Mines to the west.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,0,AGHHHH! INTRUDER!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
29,1,Hello$ I'm sure you've heard of me but if you haven't$ I am the Hermit of Viridian.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,

35,1,I'm going to train some more before I challenge the Pewter City gym.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,0,I guess I should train my Pokemon more before making it battle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,0,Welcome to Pewter City gym! I'm Brock$ the gym leader here. ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
37,1,I'm a Pokemon breeder$ and I believe the strongest Pokemon are the ones that are loved and cared for. ,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
37,2,I've carefully raised my Pokemon and only fed them my unique brand of Pokemon food.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
37,3,You won't even be able to scratch my rock solid Pokemon!,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,
37,4,,10,,,,,5,,,,brock,yellow,102,,

38,1,Have you seen them? I want to go home but can't leave the water like this. ,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
38,2,You wouldn't happen to have an extra pair do you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,0,Fire Pokemon are weak against water types.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
39,1,So I train my fire types here$ to help them overcome their weakness.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,0,This isn't a very safe place for a kid y'know. And not just because of the nature of the work here.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
40,1,The last time a non-worker wandered over here$ one of the bosses brought them to his office.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
40,2,That person hasn't been seen since.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
40,3,Now I spend my breaks out here to keep others from making the mistake of entering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

46,0,My whole life everyone has compared to my older sisters.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
46,1,I've never been as popular$ as smart$ or as beautiful as them.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
46,2,For a long time I tried to be more like them$ but I recently learned that I'd rather just be the best Misty I can be.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
46,3,I'm determined to proved myself$ so I won't hold back!,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,
46,4,,12,,,,,5,,,,misty,blue,102,,
46,5,Seems there's still a lot more I need to learn about myself.,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,
46,6,I'm still trying to figure out who I am supposed to be. Once I know that out$ I will be unstoppable!,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,
46,7,For defeating me in battle$ I award you with this Cascade badge!,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,
46,8,I'd also like to give you this egg that will hatch into one of my favourite Pokemon.,,,,,,,298,0,,,,,,
47,0,I hope you're ready for a full commitment$ because I'm never gonna give up!,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,0,I grew up in Viridian city$ but moved here to raise a family.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
50,1,Viridian was a great place during my childhood$ but it doesn't feel safe there any more. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,0,Some days I wish our children could have grown up in the Kanto of 50 years ago.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
51,1,Everything was so much simpler back then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,0,ba doo da,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,0,My milkshake tastes funny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,0,You know$ back in the war someone once told me that taking another person's life gets easier every time.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
54,1,I found the opposite to be true$ the more suffering I witnessed the more I hated it.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
54,2,Eventually I managed to escape that life$ and now I've found a much better use for my tactical mind and training regime.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
54,3,Prepare to be shocked by my Pokemon's incredible power!,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,
54,4,,14,,,,,5,,,,surge,green,102,,
54,5,They taught me a lot in the service$ but they didn't teach me compassion.,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,
54,6,I've still got a lot to learn about how to love and care for my Pokemon.,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,
54,7,If there ever comes a time when I'm capable of loving again$ then we will be truly powerful!,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,
54,8,Take this Thunder badge$ or no one will believe you managed to beat me.,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,
54,9,You can also have this$ an egg that will hatch into a shocking Pokemon!,,,,,,,239,0,,,,,,
55,0,WITNESS THE POWER OF YOUTH!,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,2,I guess I just have to work even harder!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,0,Welcome to the jungle!,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,0,One of life's greatest challenges is finding peace in such a choatic world. ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
58,1,I was able to find peace with nature$ which led to my love of grass Pokemon. ,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
58,2,I've formed an incredibly strong bond with my Pokemon$ and now you will witness the strength of our friendship!,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
58,3,,15,,,,,4,,,,erika,green,102,,

59,1,Perhaps a battle will distract me from worrying.,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,0,Zzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!,2000,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,0,I love this gym$ the gym leader is a powerful and independent young woman.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
61,1,She is a great role model for all the young girls living in this city!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,0,This gym is great! The gym leader is a handsome young man in great shape.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,0,I thought becoming a Pokemon trainer would be a good way to meet girls$ but so far it isn't working.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
63,1,I'm stuck battling kids and old men$ where are the chicks?,24,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
63,2,Maybe I'll try moving to a different route$ the girls have gotta be somewhere!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,0,In my life I've found that while people may tell you it's okay to be different$ they ultimately expect you to be like everyone else.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
64,1,My parents never accepted me for my differences$ choosing to believe I was only trying to get attention.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
64,2,I became a musician so that children could hear songs about acceptance and embracing our differences.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
64,3,I want my songs to give them the support my parents never gave me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,0,The police recently captured a Team Rocket grunt who could face 20 years in jail.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
65,1,I was chosen to be on the jury. How certain should I be of his guilt before I vote he is guilty? 80%? 95%? ,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
65,3,Even if I'm 95% sure$ there's still a 5% chance I'm locking away an innocent man for 20 years.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
65,4,The only thing I'm certain of is that I will lose sleep over this. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,0,Have you ever met someone so amazing$ that they inspire you to try and be a better person?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
66,1,I did once$ so I married her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,0,A lot of people think that in most relationships there is a winner and a loser. ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
67,1,But what they don't realize is that if you find the right person you are both winners.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
67,2,Because your love for each other motivates you to grow and be the best you can be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,0,It has been way too long since I had a good nectarine.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
68,1,Lately they are all bland or dry$ it's been very disappointing.,25,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
68,2,I can't even focus on a battle$ all I can think about is nectarines. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,0,Beat it kid$ can't you see we're busy?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
69,1,,,,69,0,,,,,,,,,,
71,0,I hear you get a rare Pokemon egg if you manage to win the Pokemon tournament.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
71,1,I want to enter$ but I'm too nervous of losing in front of such a large crowd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,0,I went on first dates with five different guys$ and talked them all into helping me move.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
72,1,Not only did I get movers for free$ but I also got free dinners from each of them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,0,I've caught some of these movers making kissy faces at my girlfriend.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
73,1,Someone is gonna get their ass kicked real soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,0,I don't know why she asked for my help when she already hired so many movers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,0,I've only been on one date with this girl and I'm already hauling furniture around.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
75,1,I can tell this one is going to be a lot of work$ but she is pretty cute!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,0,Man$ these movers look like a bunch of losers! Where did she find these guys?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,0,These guys don't seem to have a clue what they are doing.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
77,1,Whatever she paid for these ''movers'' was definitely too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,0,Did you just hear something scurrying around? Is that a Rattata?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
78,1,Okay that's it! We're moving! I will not tolerate infestation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

86,1,(This Pokemon seems very unhappy),,,,,,-1,,,,,,,,
87,0,As a child I developed psychic powers that changed my life forever.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
87,1,One fateful school day I showed off my powers in an attempt to make friends$ and instead I was labeled a freak and hated by all.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
87,2,It was hard growing up with nothing to comfort me but my powers and a father who struggled to relate with me.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,
87,3,I have used my powers to become to most powerful psychic trainer ever!,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,
87,4,,16,,,,,5,,,,sabrina,purple,102,,

88,1,Catch a lot of Pokemon$ train them well$ and shove it up your butt!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,0,I do not train to fight$ I train so I won't have to fight.,27,,,,,1,,,,,,,,

90,0,I hope your shoes are clean$ kid. I've spent hours waxing these floors. ,28,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
90,1,Our battle made a mess of these floors. I'll get back to waxing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,0,I like how often our company gets lunch catered.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
91,1,But they always get too many oatmeal raisin cookies and not enough chocolate chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,0,I swear our CEO must own stock in a raisin company or something.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
92,1,I've never seen so many raisins in my life!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,0,I have a theory that people are taking oatmeal raisin cookies by accident because they think it's chocolate chip.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
93,1,But now the company thinks everyone just really likes oatmeal raisin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,0,Don't tell anyone$ but I actually really like oatmeal raisin cookies.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
94,1,They let me a have a treat but are healthy enough I don't have to feel guilty after.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
94,2,I could never let my team find out though$ they seem to hate oatmeal raisin cookies more than Team Rocket. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,0,I'm stuck in boring meetings all day$ I want some excitement!,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,0,You know$ it's important to take breaks if you spend a long time sitting at a computer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,0,Do you know how many Pokemarts there are in Kanto?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
97,1,That's not a riddle$ I actually need to know for this report I'm working on but I have no idea...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,0,I'm the CEO of Pokemart Inc. Unforuntately that means I don't have the time to chat with all the kids who randomly wander in here.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
98,1,Now be a good little Pokemon trainer and go buy some more Pokeballs. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,0,I think the woman who sits across from me wants me to ask her out!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
99,1,Today every time I look at her$ I catch her looking at me and smiling.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
99,2,She's really cute$ but if she says no I may die of embarassment from seeing her here every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,0,The guy who sits near me is a pretty strange guy.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
100,1,We've been here for hours and he still hasn't noticed he's wearing his shirt backwards.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,
100,2,It's a button up shirt$ how did he do the buttons on his back without realizing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,0,It's dark in the Viridian Forest$ so watch your step. I hope you're not afraid of bugs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,0,I'm too tired to take another step after walking through the whole forest.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
102,1,If you'll excuse me$ I need to get back to sitting on this disgusting floor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,0,That lazy kid is really getting on my nerves$ but I don't have any actual authority so I can't kick him out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,0,You should really have adult supervision if you're going to going swimming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
