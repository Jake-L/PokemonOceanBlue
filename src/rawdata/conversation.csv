0,0,Hello young trainer my name is Professor Oak$ the leading Pokemon researcher in Kanto,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
0,1,Today is the day I give new trainers their first Pokemon,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
0,2,All I ask in return is that you take this Pokedex and catch as many Pokemon as you can,,,,,,3,,,,,,,
0,3,There was a time I would have done that myself$ but I'm not as young as I once was,,,,,,4,,,,,,,
0,4,Between you and me$ I can't even remember my grandson's name anymore,,,,,,5,,,,,,,
0,5,Anyhow$ now it's time to pick a Pokemon and begin your adventure!,,,,,,6,,,,,,,
0,6,Which one would you like?,,,,,0,7,,,,,,,
0,7,Ahh Bulbasaur$ an excellent choice!,,,,,,12,1,5,,,,,
0,8,I hope you can handle Charmander$ they tend to be quite hot-headed!,,,,,,12,4,5,,,,,
0,9,Squirtle is a very popular choice for new trainers!,,,,,,12,7,5,,,,,
0,10,Pikachu$ that's a unique choice!,,,,,,12,25,5,,,,,
0,11,Eevee is an excellent choice$ it is a very versatile Pokemon!,,,,,,12,133,5,,,,,
0,12,Take good care of it!,,,23,,,,,,-2,,,,
1,0,I heard Professor Oak has been looking for you,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
1,1,Why don't you visit him and see what he wants,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,0,Many years ago there were less than 200 species of Pokemon in the Kanto region,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
2,1,Now there are over 400 different Pokemon to be found!,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
2,2,It is a great time to be a Pokemon scientist!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,0,It is important to take good care of your Pokemon,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,1,If you are nice to them and take good care of them$ they may perform better in battle!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,0,Hi$ I just caught my first Pokemon and I want to use it! Let's battle!,0,,,,,1,,,,,,,
4,1,I guess I should train my Pokemon more before making it battle,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
4,2,,,,0,,,,,,36,,,,
5,0,Have you been to Viridian City?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
5,1,I've heard the Gym Leader there is the strongest in all of Kanto.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
5,2,I can't seem to remember his name though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,0,Our daughter left recently to begin her Pokemon journey...,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
6,1,She was sending us a letter almost every week to let us know how she was doing...,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
6,2,But the past month we haven't got any letters from her and I'm starting to get worried.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,
6,3,Do you think you could keep an eye out for her on your journey? Her name is Cassie.,,,,,,4,,,,,,,
6,4,Last we heard she was heading to Pewter City to fight the Gym Leader there.,,,,,,5,,,,,,,
6,5,Anyway$ if you hear anything$ let me know. I just want to know she is safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,0,One day$ I'm going to start my own Pokemon journey just like my sister!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,0,...,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
8,1,What could have happened to her?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,0,Hi$ I know what you're thinking. This house is too big for one person...,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
9,1,But the price was right and it's so close to my work at Oak's Lab!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,0,Hey$ can I let you in a secret? I wish I could go live somewhere else further from work.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
10,1,I'm always running into people from work on the weekends and it's just kinda weird y'know?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,0,Hi$ my friend just helped me catch this Ralts. But I won't need help to defeat you!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
11,1,,1,,,,,,,,,wally,green,107,
12,0,Hey$ have you seen my brother Gary? ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
12,1,No? Okay well he wanted me to tell you that he already has his pokemon and he wants to battle.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
12,2,I think he's on his way to Viridian City if you want to find him. Good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,0,Hey$ it sure took you long enough to get here!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
13,1,Your pokemon look almost as weak as their trainer!,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
13,2,All right$ let's battle!,,,,,,3,,,,,,,
13,3,,2,,,,,4,,,,gary,blue,103,
13,4,Ha! Maybe I won't go so easy on you next time.,,,,,,5,,,,,,,

18,0,Hey$ yeah sure you can come into my house without knocking.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
18,1,Uhh$ sorry. I didn't mean that.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
18,2,I've just been a little on edge lately what with all the team rocket guys around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,0,*sigh*,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
19,1,I haven't been able to see my family in months.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
19,2,They only live in Celadon$ but GioCorp's been giving me so many hours I barely have time to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,0,Hello there.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
20,1,Have you seen the GioCorp Mine? There's some cool pokemon there.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
20,2,Team Rocket guards the entrance during work hours$ but you could probably sneak in at night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,0,I can't believe I paid three months salary for this Magikarp...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,0,Hmm?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
22,1,Who are you?,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
22,2,Ah$ figures. Most the travellers we get around here are also trainers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,0,You should go see Professor Oak to get a Pokemon before wandering into wild grass.,,,23,,,,,,,,,,
24,0,Sorry$ you can't enter wild grass without a Pokemon.,,,23,,,1,,,,,,,
24,1,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,
25,0,I like turtles.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,0,HIIYYAAAAAH!!! YOU'RE MINE BUG!!!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
26,1,Hey wait$ you're not a bug Pokemon.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,0,I heard the reason there's no rocket goons here in Viridian is that the gym leader here keeps em out.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
27,1,I don't know who this gym leader is but he has my thanks.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
27,2,I was worried when team rocket started gaining prescence in this area I would have to move my family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,0,You may have noticed there are a lot of miners around here.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
28,1,It's because most of the people who live here work at the GioCorp Mines to the west.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,0,AGHHHH! INTRUDER!,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
29,1,Hello$ I'm sure you've heard of me but if you haven't$ I am the Hermit of Viridian.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
29,2,I battle the trainers who pass through Viridian.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,

35,1,I'm going to train some more before I challenge the Pewter City gym.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,0,I guess I should train my Pokemon more before making it battle…,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,0,Welcome to Pewter City gym! I'm Brock$ the gym leader here. ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
37,1,I'm a Pokemon breeder$ and I believe the strongest Pokemon are the ones that are loved and cared for. ,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
37,2,I've carefully raised my Pokemon and only fed them my unique brand of Pokemon food.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,
37,3,You won't even be able to scratch my rock solid Pokemon!,,,,,,4,,,,,,,
37,4,,10,,,,,5,,,,brock,yellow,102,

39,0,Fire Pokemon are weak against water types.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
39,1,So I train my fire types here$ to help them overcome their weakness.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,0,This isn't a very safe place for a kid y'know. And not just because of the nature of the work here.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
40,1,The last time a non-worker wandered over here$ one of the bosses brought them to his office.,,,,,,2,,,,,,,
40,2,That person hasn't been seen since.,,,,,,3,,,,,,,
40,3,Now I spend my breaks out here to keep others from making the mistake of entering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
