If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for [HP]{mechanic:hp} (such as []{ability:volt-absorb} absorbing []{move:thunder-wave})$ such moves will not be blocked.[]{item:life-orb} and berries that cause [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} still work as normal$ but their respective [HP]{mechanic:hp} loss and [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} are absorbed/blocked by the doll.The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field]{mechanic:field}$ such as by []{move:pursuit} or []{move:spikes}; however$ the doll will block the [poison]{mechanic:poison} effect of []{move:toxic-spikes}.The doll is passed on by []{move:baton-pass}.
